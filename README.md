This is an attempt to learn more about web app programming in Next JS. To build this I followed a tutorial by "CodeWithAntonio" on Youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffJ38dBzrlY). He also has a GitHub repository with the same code. However, I did not copy and paste his code, I followed his tutorial and rebuilt it myself. If you want access to the original repo, head down here: https://github.com/AntonioErdeljac/next13-ai-saas

##Key skills I honed while creating this feature-rich web application

- Tailwind CSS for responsive design and animations.
- Clerk for diverse authentication methods (Email, Google, multiple social logins).
- Form validation with react-hook-form and error handling using react-toast.
- Integrating Open AI and Replicate AI tools for image, video, conversation, and music generation.
- Implementing Stripe for subscription management with API limitations.
- Writing and handling POST, DELETE, GET routes in Next.js 13.
- Direct database access in server-side React components.
- Efficiently organizing Next.js folder structures and reusing layouts.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
